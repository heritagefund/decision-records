## Context
Following 10 months of research ([Discovery](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works)) and prototyping ([Alpha](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-alpha-phase-works)), the Digital Service Design team have launched a pilot application form service for £3,000-£10,000 applicants in Scotland, supported by a pilot deployment of the Salesforce Investment Management System.  

The purpose of this pilot ([private beta](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-beta-phase-works)) is to take our best idea from the alpha prototyping and start building and testing it with real users. It also involves thinking about how the service will integrate with (or start to replace) existing services, and preparing for the transition to live. 

The idea of a private beta is to roll out the service to real users - while minimising risk and maximising the potential to learn and iterate the service. 

It’s important we make sure: 

- the service team has the capacity to sustain that learning and iteration throughout the beta period 

- support staff are able to cope with new users who might struggle to use the service in ways you haven’t foreseen 

We can’t really put an end date on this phase until we start to see applications coming in, and start getting feedback and insight from users through analytics and research.  

The pilot needs to run for long enough for us to see a range of applicants and applications using the service, and to gather enough data to be confident that we’ve built the right thing and built the thing right.  

That helps us understand which improvements or enhancements are the highest priority, as well as pointing us to anything that needs fixing or changing before more applicants, staff, locations or grant programmes start using the service.  


## Decision

We’ve planned for the pilot to run for at least 3 months. During this period, we’ll be gathering insight through data and research, making continuous improvements and extending the pilot service to post-decision steps, as well as planning what happens next. 

Some of the most important improvements are focused on making the service resilient and robust. These improvements aren’t directly user facing, but ensure that staff and applicants can trust the service, and that the team can be proactive in identifying and fixing technical issues.  

We’ll use the data and research insights we gather during the pilot to develop a plan for the next steps in 3 different ways:  

- Enhancing – adding extra features and improving those that are there 

- Extending – adding steps that come before an application, and those which come after a decision 

- Rolling out – making the service available to more users, either by extending the Small Grants service to other locations, or by developing the service to function for larger grant programmes. 

## Consequences

Further roll out of the service is dependent on the scale and complexity of enhancements and extensions needed, and their importance for users.  

Once we have a plan, we can be clearer about potential consequences of an emphasis on enhancing, extending or rolling out over and above one another.
