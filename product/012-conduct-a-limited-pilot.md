# 12. Conduct a limited pilot of the small grants application service

## Context

When approving the Business Case for the new investment management system the Finance Resources and Staffing Committee minuted that they did not want the new service launched with a big bang but incrementally, following best practice in technology and software rollouts. The project board have previously approved plans to roll out the new investment service, underpinned by the grant management system, in a staged, incremental way.  

This proposal is for who the first stage of that incremental roll out will include, and where it will take place.  

In making this proposal, we have considered where there are existing Fund strategies or campaigns that might provide a suitable group for an initial pilot (or [Private Beta](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-beta-phase-works), in alignment with the Government Service Manual) to minimise the impact on internal users of operating the private beta service in parallel to the existing legacy service during the period of transition.  

In order to be useful as a private beta, the cohort we choose needs to allow us to test that the service works for everyone – it needs to include users of different experience and ability levels, from different socio-economic groups and backgrounds, and to include some users with access needs, lower digital confidence, a range of technical tools and resources (things like slower internet connections, different devices, and so on).  

A private beta also needs to allow us to [validate that the service we have built solves a whole problem for users](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-beta-phase-works#solving-a-whole-problem-for-users), and that we can deliver and operate it at the scale we need, which in this case is a UK wide service open to everyone, supporting all our open grant programmes.  

This means we need a cohort that is large enough to be sufficiently diverse and representative, but that is small enough to manage the levels of risk and the frequency of change that we’d expect in the very first version of the service to see real world use.  


## Decision

The private beta will be conducted with all applicants for grants of up to £10,000 including supporting the [Year of Coasts and Waters](https://www.visitscotland.com/about/themed-years/coasts-waters/) marketing campaign being run from the Fund’s Scotland office in early 2020. We intend to launch the private beta at the end of January 2020, with any necessary training delivered in December 2019.  

Scope: Like ‘Year of Young People’ this year is external to the Fund and part of the ‘themed years’ run in Scotland to highlight different parts of their culture, so will be running regardless of any Fund activity, however the Scotland office are keen to engage with it as a marketing campaign. If they decide not to take it on as a marketing campaign we can still run the pilot, but in that instance focusing upon all small grants under £10,000. 

The current proposal is that applicants to under £10k in Scotland will be directed to a new web page linking to the new application forms and portal and assessing officers in the Scotland office will use the new internal system to assess and monitor these cases. 

Timetable: The private beta itself will run for three months, including continuous improvement to the service, before a decision point at the end of the Financial year about whether to continue in just one country or roll out to a further area or country. 

Rationale: We think this will enable us to test the accessibility and inclusivity of the new service to a broad range of applicants, including some who will never have applied for funding before. We expect applicants to be broadly representative in terms of demographics, heritage type and organisation type and to come from a mixture of urban and rural locations and with a diverse set of technical resources available. Looking at historic data our Data Manager considers Scotland to be representative.  

Scotland is a clearly defined area which has no cross territory projects under £10k, so clarity of where to apply for applicants should be clear. The risk of doing this in England is that whilst there are three areas we are more likely to have border cross territory cases and it may be confusing to applicants, especially if we need to move them between areas. This would not be possible on the new system as only one area would be able to take part. Politically, it would be more advantageous to start with a country rather than an England focus for a strategic project of this nature.  

Additionally, of the three countries, Scotland does not have its own language legislation, or additional Equality Impact Assessment requirements if we decide to make it the first country we roll out on. Wales and Northern Ireland also have much smaller caseloads which will not give us the throughput of projects to allow for fast iteration. 

We believe this approach will have enough applications to allow us to test the service as we need to, whilst being sufficiently distinct from other grant campaigns and small enough in volume to be manageable for the internal users of the new service.  Last F/Y the Scotland team assessed 400 applications of which 300 were as a result of ‘Year of Young People’ campaign. Therefore over the initial three month period we would expect to see up to 100 cases go through the system, likely less, given the drop off in applications under SFF, but giving enough throughput to be able to test and validate assumptions. 

Crucially it will also enable us to beta test the new internal system and processes for small grants with staff from all roles in Business Delivery, of which Scotland is also representative. This will include testing the training proposals, communication methodology, system functionality and technical considerations of the system. This will allow us to identify any constraints prior to any more extensive roll out. The distribution of the Scotland team and any technical or infrastructure challenges they experience are therefore helpful for us in validating that the service will work at the scale and within all the constraints faced by colleagues at the Fund.  

The work will be supported by continuous active evaluation and user research to ensure feedback is quickly captured and can be acted upon. Various members of the team will go up to Scotland as required, including User Research and Training/ support in particular. Where there is not sufficient space additional rooms will be hired in Edinburgh for training. 

## Consequences

This means that the readiness of the service for private beta will become a potential dependency for the launch of the marketing campaign if we want to use this as part of the pilot. We will need to work closely with Business Delivery colleagues in Scotland to ensure this dependency is managed effectively, and staff have the information they need to advise and support applicants and prospective applicants.  

We will need to identify if there are key decision makers who need to agree to this proposal not represented within the Project Board, for example Exec, and the timescales they work to. Assumption is that this can be agreed by Sue Bowers and Eilish McGuinness.  

We will need to undertake some further analysis and set some key updated metrics for our private beta to validate that our understanding of the makeup of this cohort meets the needs we have to be able to proceed to a public beta or extended private beta for other regions, campaigns and open programmes, and to ensure that we can use the private beta to identify any obstacles to scaling, roll out, or further iteration of the service to support the goal of a national service for all grant programmes.  

We will need to devise a plan with the Director of Scotland and her team as well as Legal and Governance and Finance colleagues to work up proposals with them.  

We will need to communicate the decision to the wider organisation including timetables and comms messages.
