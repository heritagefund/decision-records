# 5. Capture all volunteer time at application as a single volunteer type

Date: 2019-11-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

In the existing application forms, applicants are asked to break down volunteer hours by the type of volunteer input, providing the following guidance: 

<em>By volunteers we mean the people who are contributing their time to help deliver your project rather than only taking part in it. 

This could include administrative work, leading a guided walk, clearing a site or working as a steward at an event. 

You can include costs for volunteer training, travel and expenses in Section 3a.

- Professional labour (for example - accountancy or teaching) - £50 an hour; 
- Skilled labour (for example - administrative work, carpentry or leading a guided walk - £20 an hour; 
- Volunteer (for example, clearing a site or working as a steward at an event) - £10 an hour 
  </em>

In the past, this information was drawn into overall project budgets. This is no longer the case. 

During research, we have seen that wehn the hourly equivalent value is shown, applicants tend to select the skilled or professional categories. When no hourly equivalent value is shown, applicants tend to place all volunteer input in the 'volunteer' category. This suggests that any data that can be drawn from this information is unlikely to be accurate. 


## Decision

We will not ask applicants to choose a category of volunteer. We will ask applicants to describe volunteer activities and the estimated hours. 

We will explore options for capturing accurate volunteer numbers and categories during monitoring and evaluation. 

## Consequences

Potential policy consequences have been discussed and approved by the relevant policy lead. 

We will need to reflect this decision in the application form built for beta.
