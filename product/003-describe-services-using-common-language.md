# 3. Describe services using a common language

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As a multidisciplinary team working in an agile way on a service transformation, we orientate our work around users and their needs, as part of a wider coherent service. In order for us to maintain that shared focus and clear scope of work, we need a way to talk about the wider coherent service we're working on. It's important that we can talk about the wider service in a clear and accessible way which reflects users and their needs, rather than organisational structures. 

We have used information shared by colleagues who also work in service design: 
from [Melanie Cannon’s fantastic blog post](https://medium.com/leading-service-design/helping-teams-define-their-focus-f7c92932c2f3), Kate Tarling discussing language and structure [in this blog post](https://hodigital.blog.gov.uk/2016/12/21/creating-a-common-language-to-describe-services/), and 
[advice on naming your service](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/naming-your-service) from the UK government’s Service Design Manual. 

We expect the way we name and describe these services to evolve over time as we learn more about our users, their motivations and needs, and the language they use. We are capturing these descriptions in this decision record in full so that we can keep a history of versions, as well as track comments and issues relating to this content in an open way. 

## Decision

### Service: Get funding for a heritage project
#### Sub service: Apply for funding for a heritage project
Offer a simple, accessible way for people to find, evaluate and apply for funding that will support their heritage projects. 

Lets people who are involved with a heritage project understand what funding is available for projects like theirs, evaluate available funding based on the criteria that are important to them, and follow a set of clear, simple steps to apply for funding confidently, collaboratively, and quickly. 

#### Sub service: Manage existing funding for a heritage project
Offer a simple, accessible way for people to report on the progress of their project so they can meet the terms of their funding and secure their next payment. 

Lets people who are involved with projects which have already been granted funding from the National Lottery Heritage Fund provide required information and evidence about their project and the work done to support later rounds of payment and ensure that their project delivers its outcomes. 

#### Sub service: Manage funding applications and grants 
Provide National Lottery Heritage Fund staff with a simple, accessible and stable way to manage heritage projects at all stages of the funding cycle, including pre-application advice and engagement, application and evaluation, and due diligence, payments, and monitoring. 

Lets staff across the National Lottery Heritage Fund review new applications in a simple, fair and consistent way, as well as supporting long term engagement and relationships with funded projects and organisations to secure better heritage outcomes. Lets staff across the National Lottery Heritage Fund monitor project progress and make payments in a simple, auditable way. 


## Consequences

These definitions give us a way of talking clearly and consistently about the scope of our work. They should be a reflection of our users and their language, so they will change over time as we learn and iterate. Therefore, anywhere we make use of these names and definitions will need to be flexible enough to accommodate changes over time. 

These definitions span the organisation because these services span the organisation. It is not a consequence of this naming that any organisational structures or responsibilities change.
