# 2. Make iterative changes to the existing website

Date: 2019-05-30

## Status

Proposed

## Context

We are undertaking user research with internal and external users of the end to end investment process. That includes grant applicants, grantees, and internal staff at the Fund. We are also undertaking analysis of the data and insights available through web analytics, surveys, and informal feedback from staff and external users. 

Through this process, we are identifying immediate changes we can make to parts of the end to end process which could improve things for users right away. This process is also informing a higher level service design for the end to end journeys. 

Working iteratively helps us to start improving things for users more quickly, and supports the continuous learning and research of the team which informs the wider service design. 

Working iteratively also helps minimise the risk of spending lots of time and energy working on a large number of related changes which, once deployed, do not solve the problem users are having. Working iteratively minimises waste and risk, and enables the team to be flexible and change direction if research and analysis indicates higher value work is possible. 

The value of improved usability outweighs the potential challenge of inconsistent design for users. 

## Decision

We will make regular, iterative changes to the live website at [https://www.heritagefund.org.uk](https://www.heritagefund.org.uk) where we identify an opportunity to improve the usability or accessibility for users who are applying for or receiving funding from us. 

We will not make a large suite of changes in a development environment or as prototypes, and wait to deploy these to the live website in a single ‘relaunch’. We will instead deploy prototyped or iterative changes as soon as they have been approved by the Service Owner, or a member of the team that the Service Owner has delegated responsibility to for that purpose. 

Approval will be based on user research insights and evidence from data, as well as the priorities set out in [our roadmap](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kxuDrZ4=/).


## Consequences

Parts of the website will begin to deviate from others in terms of content style and design. This may mean a slightly disrupted journey for users. We will need to ensure iterations are set in the context of broader product strategy and the milestones set in [our roadmap](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kxuDrZ4=/) 

We will consider how iterations affect the wider task or journey a user is undertaking, and take reasonable steps to minimise short term disruption so that users can still navigate the parts of the website they need independently. This might involve implementing redirects between pages to avoid misleading paths for users, or releasing iterations in a particular order to support the best possible user experience.
