# Use Salesforce for grant management 

Date – 2019-07-23 

## Status 
Accepted 

## Context 
The National Lottery Heritage Fund has run a procurement process to support the development of a new investment management process and system. Our procurement method followed the Government’s procurement policy which directs Arms Length Bodies towards Crown Commercial Services (CCS), which for IT purchases dictates the use of Frameworks held within their digital marketplace program known as G Cloud 10 which holds specific Providers for IT products, hosting and support services. 

## Decision 
The recommendation from the evaluation of systems and providers was supported at all levels and the Project Board approved Salesforce with Methods Business Technology as the selected Providers. 

## Consequences 
The new service will be built using a Salesforce platform with support from Methods Business Technology for the first phase of work. After this it is envisaged that further enhancements will be delivered in house.
