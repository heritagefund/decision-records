# 8. Take a light touch approach to word counts

Date: 2019-11-1

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Word counts are a common feature of free text fields in forms. In the Investment Service, word counts currently feature in multiple places on each application form, and in the case papers Investment Managers complete during assessment.  

We have seen in research that users typically recognise word counts, and use them in two somewhat contradictory ways:  

- to understand the level of detail their answer needs to contain 

- as a tool for editing their answer between drafting and submission (this often creates friction and frustration) 

We have seen that these patterns are common to the vast majority of digital interactions featuring word counts.  

We could invest significant time and effort doing in depth standalone research into how users understand and make use of word counts, but it’s unlikely that doing so would generate much if any useful additional insight that could inform our design work.  


## Decision

We will test word counts (including their presence or absence) only as an incidental part of the overall service, journeys, or experience. This will allow us to calibrate and implement word counts to best support users, whilst maximising the impact of our research efforts overall. 

We’ll refer to existing design patterns and research for word counts, such as [those used by GOV.UK](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system/wiki/Character-count-testing-and-user-research), or in the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/character-count/) developed collaboratively by design teams across government.
