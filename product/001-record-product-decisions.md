# 1. Record product decisions

Date: 2019-05-07

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the product decisions made on this project, including the context, rationale and date. This will help maintain common understanding across the wider project team, and enable us to review past decisions when the context or the basis for a decision change.

## Decision

We will capture Product Decisions in this repository. We will not capture day-to-day decisions, but those material to the product direction, scope, or approach. Publication in Github allows us to track issues and responses relating to a decision, as well as track the history of changes. 

In particular, we recognise that decisions can be proposed and accepted, as well as deprecated or superseded, as we continue to iterate and learn. 

Decisions have the status of ‘Proposed’ until they have been approved by the project board. 

## Consequences

None
