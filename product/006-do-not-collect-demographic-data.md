# 6. Do not collect demographic data at application

Date: 2019-11-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

In the current application forms, applicants are asked to provide a detailed breakdown on the diversity of the staff and volunteers, in a set of tables for gender, age, disability and impairment, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and community background (NI only) 

The way this information is described, gathered and used is currently in review for the Fund as a whole, by colleagues in the Business Innovation and Insights team.  

We have seen applicants routinely struggle with the layout of this section of the form, and with understanding what it is asking them to provide.  

We have seen applicants skip this optional section entirely, as a huge amount of difficult work at the very end of the application process. We have also seen applicants make best efforts to complete this section with information they know to be inaccurate, although our guidance states ‘Please include all the information you have available (that is obtained through formal monitoring, not based on assumptions or informal knowledge). Please do not provide data if you are not sure.’ 


## Decision

We will not ask for or collect demographic data in the private beta for £3,000 - £10,000 grants. We will continue to communicate with colleagues in the Business Innovation and Insight department on progress on the demographic data collection for the Fund as a whole, and incorporate future agreed collection mechanisms and descriptions into the application form as appropriate and proportionate.  

## Consequences

Demographic data will not be available for projects which apply through the private beta.
