# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This repository servers as the architecture decision log for the Digital Service Design team.

## What is an architecture decision record?

An *architectural decision record* (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision, including its context and consequences.

An *architecture decision* (AD) is a software design choice that addresses a significant requirement.

An *architecture decision log* (ADL) is the collection of all ADRs created and maintained for a particular project (or organisation).

An *architecturally-significant requirement* (ASR) is a requirement that has a measurable effect on a software system's architecture.


All of these sit within the domain of *architecture knowledge management* (AKM).
